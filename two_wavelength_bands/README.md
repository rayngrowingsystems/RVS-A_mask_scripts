# Combine Two Wavelength Band Masks into One Mask

This masking script combines the binary sub-masks of two wavelength bands and respective thresholds into one binary mask. 
The wavelength bands can be selected from a drop-down menu and the thresholds can be adjusted via sliders.
The logical operation (combination) can be selected via a drop-down menu.

AND = pixels are white where both single-index masks are white

OR = pixels are white where either single-index mask is white
[(plantCV documentation)](https://plantcv.readthedocs.io/en/stable/logical_or/) \
XOR = differences between both single-index masks
