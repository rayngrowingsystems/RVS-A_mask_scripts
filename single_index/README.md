# Single Index Mask

This masking script uses a single reflection index and a threshold to create a binary mask. 
The reflection index can be selected from a drop-down menu and the threshold can be adjusted via a slider.

Note: Different reflection indices have different ranges. The slider ranges are adjusted accordingly.
(See file rayn_utils.py for available indices and the respective ranges)
